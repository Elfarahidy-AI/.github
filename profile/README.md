# Arabic Language Processing Organization

Welcome to the Arabic Language Processing Organization on GitHub! We are dedicated to developing and maintaining repositories that focus on various aspects of Arabic language processing. Our goal is to provide valuable resources and tools for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working with the Arabic language.

## Repositories

### 1. Arabic Spelling Errors Detection and Correction

The **Arabic Spelling Errors Detection and Correction** repository contains code and resources for detecting and correcting spelling errors in Arabic text. It includes algorithms, datasets, and pre-trained models that can be used to improve the accuracy of Arabic spell checkers.

### 2. Arabic Grammatical Errors Detection and Correction

The **Arabic Grammatical Errors Detection and Correction** repositories focuses on identifying and correcting grammatical errors in Arabic sentences. It provides tools and datasets for training and evaluating models that can detect and suggest corrections for common grammatical mistakes in Arabic writing.

### 3. Arabic Diacritization

The **Arabic Diacritization** repository tackles the task of adding diacritical marks to Arabic text. Diacritization is essential for disambiguating the pronunciation and meaning of Arabic words. This repository offers datasets, models, and code for automatic diacritization of Arabic text.

### 4. Arabic OCR for Handwritten Text

The **Arabic OCR for Handwritten Text** repository is dedicated to the task of optical character recognition (OCR) for handwritten Arabic text. It provides datasets, pre-trained models, and code for extracting and recognizing Arabic characters from handwritten documents or images.
